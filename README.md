# fcc-projects
These are the projects I created for the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python certification. Every project had a starter code provided since the goal was
to pass their official tests that needed exact variable names and output forms.

1. mean_var_std.py. In this project, I created a function that has a list of 9 items as its argument. It requires 9 items because we can create a 3x3 matrix 
with that. Based on this array, we derive the mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum and sum for both axes and their respective total values.

2. demo_data.py. I analysed a dataset about demographics. It is mainly about age, race, salary and education. FreeCodeCamp has provided the data source:
Dua, D. and Graff, C. (2019). UCI Machine Learning Repository. Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science.

3. medical_data.py. This file is focused on medical examination data. I combined columns to calculate the BMI for each person and also normalized the data 
using 0 and 1 values. After doing some grouping and data cleaning, it was possible to create interesting visualizations.

4. time_series.py. The project focuses on a time series analysis of freeCodeCamp's website visits for a certain time period. It is mostly about drawing all
kinds of plots.

5. sea_level.py. It's about predicting the sea level for the year 2050, based on the rising trend since 2000. The data source was cited as follows:
Global Average Absolute Sea Level Change, 1880-2014 from the US Environmental Protection Agency using data from CSIRO, 2015; NOAA, 2015.
