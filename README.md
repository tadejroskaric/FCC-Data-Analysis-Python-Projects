# fcc-projects
These are the projects I created for the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python certification

1. mean_var_std.py. In this project, I created a function that has a list of 9 items as its argument. It requires 9 items because we can create a 3x3 matrix 
with that. Based on this array, we derive the mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum and sum for both axes and their respective total values.
